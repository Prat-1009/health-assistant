Pregnancy and breastfeeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. You and your doctor should decide if you should receive infliximab while you are pregnant or breastfeeding. If you have a baby and you were receiving infliximab during your pregnancy, it is important to tell your baby’s doctor and other health care professionals about your infliximab use so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. Certain vaccinations can cause infections. If you received infliximab while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection. If your baby receives a live vaccine within 6 months after birth, your baby may develop infections with serious complications that can lead to death. This includes live vaccines such as the BCG, rotavirus, or any other live vaccines. For other types of vaccines, talk with your doctor Storage Store unopened infliximab vials in a refrigerator at 2ºC to 8ºC (36ºF to 46ºF). If needed, unopened infliximab vials may be stored at room temperatures up to a maximum of 30ºC (86°F) for a single period of up to 6 months but not exceeding the original expiration date. The new expiration date must be written in the space provided on the carton. Once removed from the refrigerator, infliximab cannot be returned to the refrigerator.

Continue reading What is the difference between Renflexis and Remicade? Renflexis (infliximab-abda) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker that is biosimilar to Remicade (infliximab). A biosimilar has no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness from the reference product. Renflexis is given as an intravenous (IV) infusion similar to Remicade, and is used for the same conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. Biosimilars may lead to cost-savings due to a lower price and are preferred by some insurance companies.

Keep a list of your medicines and show them to your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. You and your doctor should decide if you should receive infliximab while you are pregnant or breastfeeding. If you have a baby and you were receiving infliximab during your pregnancy, it is important to tell your baby’s doctor and other health care professionals about your infliximab use so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. Certain vaccinations can cause infections. If you received infliximab while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection. If your baby receives a live vaccine within 6 months after birth, your baby may develop infections with serious complications that can lead to death. This includes live vaccines such as the BCG, rotavirus, or any other live vaccines. For other types of vaccines, talk with your doctor Storage Store unopened infliximab vials in a refrigerator at 2ºC to 8ºC (36ºF to 46ºF). If needed, unopened infliximab vials may be stored at room temperatures up to a maximum of 30ºC (86°F) for a single period of up to 6 months but not exceeding the original expiration date. The new expiration date must be written in the space provided on the carton. Once removed from the refrigerator, infliximab cannot be returned to the refrigerator.
